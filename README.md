# zt

Utilities and glue to make working with ZeroTier networks a bit more
friendly

## Installation

At this point, `zt` is intended as a command-line tool first and a
library second (if at all). As such, instructions for usage with Bundler
or similar are not given.

If `zt` becomes useful as a library,
instructions will be provided, and if you want to try using it as a
library anyway, then best of luck to you.

`zt` can be installed with RubyGems, and is published to the default
repository. Simply do

```bash
gem install zt
```

to make the `zt` command available. Depending on your Ruby setup, you
may need to install it as a superuser, with

```bash
sudo gem install zt
```

instead.
