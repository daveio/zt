# zt

Utilities and glue to make working with ZeroTier networks a bit more
friendly

[![gem version][img-badge-gem]][link-badge-gem]

This document assumes a UNIX-like operating system.

For the vast majority of people, that means Linux, *BSD, and macOS.

It might work with Windows, but Ruby on Windows is an adventure in
itself so I'm afraid you're on your own. If you're stuck with Windows,
try setting one of the [Windows Subsystem for Linux][link-wsl] sandboxes
up - they work surprisingly well.

## Installation

At this point, `zt` is intended as a command-line tool first and a
library second (if at all). As such, instructions for usage with Bundler
or similar are not given.

If `zt` becomes useful as a library, instructions will be provided, and
if you want to try using it as a library anyway, then best of luck to
you.

`zt` can be installed with RubyGems, and is published to the default
repository. Simply install it like any other gem.

```plain
gem install zt
```

Depending on how your Ruby installation is set up, you may need to
install it as a superuser. If you're not sure, and if commands like
`rvm`, `rbenv`, and/or `ruby-build` don't ring any bells, you probably
need to install as a superuser using `sudo`.

```plain
sudo gem install zt
```

## Usage

At initial release, there's only one thing `zt` does - fetch the state of your nodes and networks, and output their IPs in `/etc/hosts` format.

To start, head to [my.zerotier.com][link-my-zerotier] and find (or generate) an API key. They're on the main page under 'API Access Tokens'. It'll be a 32-character random string.

When you have `zt` installed and you have an API key, generate your initial configuration.

```plain
zt auth YourAPIKeyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Then fetch the state of your networks and nodes.

```plain
zt pull
```

This will update the YAML files in `~/.config/zt` - if you have a reason to edit them, you can do so, but they'll be overwritten next time you run `zt pull` with exception of `zt.conf.yaml`.

You can then generate the `hosts` file entries.

```plain
zt export
```

This will print them to STDOUT, so if you want to dump them to a file just use shell redirection.

```plain
zt export > yourfilename.txt
```

For now, that's it.

## Development

- Fork the repository on GitHub.
  -  ![gem version][img-fork_button]
-  Check out your fork.
   -  `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zt`
-  Enter the checkout directory.
   - `cd zt`
- Install dependencies.
  - `bin/setup`
- Run the tests.
  - `rake spec`
- Make a new branch for your feature.
  - `git branch your-amazing-new-feature`
- Check out your new branch.
  - `git checkout your-amazing-new-feature`
- Hack away.
  - `(you have to come up with this bit yourself)`
- Make sure you add tests for your work.
  - `(this bit is boring but REALLY IMPORTANT)`
- Make sure all the tests pass, both old and new.
  - `rake spec`
- Commit and push your now-tested work to your fork.
  - `git commit && git push origin your-amazing-new-feature`
- Open a pull request and wait for a response.

**PROTIP:** You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt
that will allow you to experiment.

The [Bundler guide to gem development][link-bundler-guide] may be
helpful if this is your first gem. It certainly helped me.
